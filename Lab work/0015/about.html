          <h4>A WIDE SELECTION OF FRESHLY-PICKED EXOTIC FRUIT</h4>
          <p>
            As meat consumption reduces and the availability of plant-based
            foods rises at a staggering rate, the diet choices made by the
            public is rapidly changing (recent statistics show that the amount
            of vegetarians and vegans in the UK is at an all-time high). Our
            diverse population is creating a new demand for healthy and
            alternative produce. To illustrate this, a regular customer said:
            "Friends of mine that eat meat purchase a sirloin steak or tiger
            prawns as a luxury for dinner at the weekend. As a vegan, I treat
            myself to some hand-selected and tree-ripened organic mangoes and,
            occasionally, a whole jackfruit!" Cameron, London

          <h4>CULINARY USE</h4>
          <p>
            While most of our fruits are suitable to be eaten neat
            out of your hand, the flavour and enjoyment of some can be improved
            if they are prepared in a certain way or mixed with other
            complementary flavours. Some of our dried fruits can simply be
            steeped in hot water to create delicious medicinal teas or mixed
            into the dough of baking creations. The frozen pulps of our fruits
            are perfect to be mixed with milk or water. Our delicious fruits are
            used by some of the world’s top chefs to create gourmet recipes.

            We work closely with our suppliers, building an extensive knowledge
            of these rare and hard-to-obtain fruits. We are always looking to
            discover new and exciting fruits and are regularly updating our
            range, working hard to source organically. We have a wide range of
            customers buying our fruits for many reasons, the health benefits
            and culinary uses being the main motivation.
