        <h4>A WIDE SELECTION OF FRESHLY-PICKED EXOTIC FRUIT</h4>
        <p>
          As meat consumption reduces and the availability of plant-based
          foods rises at a staggering rate, the diet choices made by the
          public is rapidly changing (recent statistics show that the amount
          of vegetarians and vegans in the UK is at an all-time high). Our
          diverse population is creating a new demand for healthy and
          alternative produce.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To illustrate this, a regular customer said:
            "Friends of mine that eat meat purchase a sirloin steak or tiger
            prawns as a luxury for dinner at the weekend. As a vegan, I treat
            myself to some hand-selected and tree-ripened organic mangoes and,
            occasionally, a whole jackfruit!"
